# be careful with indentation and code blocks 
# Logical Operator "or" only one comparison needs to be true for the if statement to be true
#Logical Operator "and" Both comparisons need to be true for the if statement to be true
# Or and And let you combine multiple comparisons/ not negates 
#Logical operator "not" negate a comparison can help make statement more readable. Negate means make the opposite: not true becomes false, not false becomes true
# != not equal
